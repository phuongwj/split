## 🤔 About

Split-it is a tool for splitting receipts and managing expenses among groups. It makes it easy to upload a receipt, assign items to people, and quickly see who owes what. **OCR (Optical Character Recognition) support is planned**, so you'll eventually be able to upload a photo of a receipt and have it parsed automatically.
