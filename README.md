# split-it

Split-it is a backend and (soon) frontend project for splitting receipts and expenses among groups of people. The goal is to make it easy to upload a receipt, assign items to people, and quickly see who owes what. **OCR (Optical Character Recognition) support is planned** - so you'll eventually be able to upload a photo of a receipt and have it parsed automatically.
